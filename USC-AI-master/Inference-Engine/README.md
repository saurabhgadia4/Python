Inference Engine in Python

1. Developed inference engine using backward chaining algorithm very much similar to backward chaining in prolog.

2. It accepts clauses from input file to form knowledge base representated using first order logic.

3. From the built knowledge base it then infers whether the requested query is valid or not.
